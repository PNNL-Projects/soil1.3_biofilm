# Image processing

There are four channels Bright Field (BF), DAPI (Blue), GFP (Green), RFP (Red). The bright filed is just for non-fluorescence imaging. All the other three are fluorescence image. Each color means a parcitular strain. 

In this tif image, there are many layers representing z-stacks. So each image shows the 3D distribution of species.
